# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Overview
--------
This folder centralizes OctoAcme’s project management processes to ensure consistent delivery, faster onboarding, and shared understanding across teams. The documents here describe our lifecycle from project initiation through release and continuous improvement, including roles, templates, and checklists.

At-a-glance: OctoAcme process highlights
- Customer-first delivery and data-informed decisions
- Iterative delivery in small, testable increments
- Clear ownership: Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead for each project
- Explicit artifacts: One-pager, backlog, Definition of Done, Risk Register, release notes, and retrospectives
- Regular cadence: standups, weekly syncs, demos, and retrospective cycles
- Emphasis on quality: tests, CI, security scans, and smoke tests before release
